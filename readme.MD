Goal.

Create a connect 4 system that can be played by a user against and automated opponent or that can be played by two automated players. 


- [ ]		User is able to set the dimensions of the board at start		
- [ ] 		User can choose moves 										
- [ ]		Game can detect horizontal connect4s 
- [ ]		Game can detect vertical connect4s 
- [ ]		Game handles scenarios where sequential pieces are not wins (spillover)
- [ ]		User can select number of pieces to connect to win
- [ ]		Game draws a graphical representation of game 
- [ ]		Game can conect to Arduino serially 
- [ ]		Arduino can accept moves from Game and display on matrix 
- [ ]		Game tracks the progression of the game 
- [ ]		Game knows spaces that are occupied 
- [ ]		Game knows which moves are legal 
- [ ]		Game outputs information as each turn is made 
- [ ]		User can select if board is drawn at endTurn
- [ ]		User can input how many games to play in series
- [ ]		Game verifies user input before proceeding on a series 
- [ ]		Game can track the outcome of every game in a series 
- [ ]		Game displays winner and relevant information 
- [ ]		Game ends the current game following a win detect 
- [ ] 		Game can clear memory and begin a new game (if a series is set by User)
- [ ]		Enable Reinforcement Learning
- [ ]		Define conditions and rewards
- [ ]		Define what constitutes a single Step (both player completes a turn)
- [ ]		Game assigns points to each player for each game in a series
- [ ]		Game has at least 2 levels of output messages one and user can select
- [ ]		One level of output contains highly granular debug information
- [ ]		Game messages should have some formatting for presentation
